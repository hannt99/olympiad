## TODO

### Graph

* **Please learn how to solve anything on chordal graph** (Ptz 2018 Winter. Kid's Nightmare, Ptz 2019 Summer. Apollonian Network)
* PQ tree, 3-connectivity (Details written in my notion)
  * Planarity check
* Online Incremental SCC https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.0792 (Details written in my notion)
* Dynamic 2-connectivity, 3-connectivity https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.03812 (Details written in my notion)
* MCMF in $O(n \log n)$ time for series-parallel graphs
* Bipartite graph edge coloring in $O(m \log ^2 m)$ (VK Cup 2012 Privatization. CF #591 F. And 3 more)
* Matroid partitioning https://www.cc.gatech.edu/~rpeng/CS7510_F19/Sep24TreePacking.pdf

### Data structures

* Get a working splay tree implementation
* Treaps? Persistent treaps? 2-3 trees? (check ROI 2019 P8)
* Top trees (?????)
* Solve POI 2006 Tetris 3D faster than $O(n^{1 + \epsilon})$
* Solve WF 2017 Scenery in $O(n\log n)$

### Etc

* SMAWK
* Lyndon decomposition
* Push relabel flow
* Strongly polynomial mincostflow

### Maybe

* Suffix trees, suffix automaton
